# Random Square
This is a quick side project of mine. It's not a game or anything but it's just kind of like a fidget spinner. Not really a game, no one wins or loses, but just a quiet distraction from the horribilness that is life. SO it basically just moves a square in a random direction and randomly changes its color.
